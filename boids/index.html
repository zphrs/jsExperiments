		<h1>Hello, please do not scroll if you are sensitive to flashing images.</h1> <p>The image below this big box represents the gpu's calculated new direction for every boid displayed. As such, it is very flashy since it is recalculating the direction every frame, to 32 bit precision. <br>That is why this box is so big.<br>It is to make sure that the big flashing image is not displayed when the page is first loaded.</p>
