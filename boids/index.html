		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			This is a GPGPU based boids simulation that uses the WebGL 1.0 specification for good cross-browser support.
			The boids simulation is based on <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">this paper</a> by Craig Reynolds.
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>The image below this big box represents the gpu generated direction for every boid. 
			As such, it is very flashy since it is recalculating the direction every frame, to 32 bit precision. 
			<br>That is why this box is so big.
			<br>It is to make sure that the big flashing image is not displayed when the page is first loaded.
			I have tried my best to reduce the flashyness of the image while still maintaining most of the raw output from the GPU.
			Although, keep in mind that it still could cause reactions since it is a very flashy image.
